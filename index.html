     <div class="about-text">
                <p>I am Albert Einstein, the theoretical physicist known for developing the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. My groundbreaking equation, E=mc^2, showed the profound relationship between energy and mass, fundamentally altering the way we perceive the universe.</p>
                <p>Throughout my life, I dedicated myself to unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos, using mathematics and thought experiments to explore the fabric of spacetime. My work laid the foundation for many scientific advances and technological innovations, including the development of nuclear energy and the GPS system.</p>
                <p>I was also a passionate advocate for peace and social justice, believing that science and knowledge could be used to promote a better world. My words and actions continue to inspire scientists and thinkers to this day.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Reading and Learning: I was a voracious reader and had a wide-ranging curiosity. I enjoyed delving into various subjects, not just physics, as I believed that interdisciplinary knowledge was essential for creativity.</p>
        <p>Thought Experiments: Even during my leisure time, I couldn't resist pondering complex scientific problems and conducting thought experiments to explore the mysteries of the universe.</p>
        <p>Nature Walks: Spending time in nature was a source of inspiration and relaxation for me. I often took long walks to connect with the natural world and gather my thoughts.</p>
        <p>Social and Humanitarian Activities: I was deeply committed to social justice and humanitarian causes. My hobbies also included advocating for peace, civil rights, and the betterment of society through my activism and writing.</p>

        <p>The Expanding Universe

One of the most exciting developments in recent years is the confirmation of the expanding universe. Edwin Hubble's observations have shown that galaxies are moving away from each other, implying that the universe is not static but evolving. This idea aligns with my own earlier beliefs about a cosmological constant, which I once called my "greatest blunder." It turns out that the cosmological constant might have a role to play after all, in the form of dark energy.

The Quest for a Unified Theory

Throughout my career, I dreamt of finding a unified theory that would explain all the fundamental forces of nature. While I made significant contributions, such as the theory of general relativity, I never quite achieved this lofty goal. Today, physicists continue to search for a theory of everything, often referred to as "quantum gravity." I am hopeful that one day, science will uncover the elegant and unifying principles that govern the cosmos.</p>
